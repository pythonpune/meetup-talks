## Submit a talk/workshop
If you want to submit a talk for upcoming events, then you can [create
a new
issue](https://github.com/pythonpune/meetup-talks/issues/new/choose)
on this repository. Just fill in the requested details and one of us
will take care of scheduling the talk/workshop.

When a talk/workshop proposal is created, it gets labeled with
[`talk-proposal`](https://github.com/pythonpune/meetup-talks/issues?q=label:talk-proposal). Once
it's confirmed and the date is decided,
[`scheduled`](https://github.com/pythonpune/meetup-talks/issues?q=label:scheduled)
label will be added to it.

After the event, the event page will be updated with summary, slides
and code snippets of the talk. Once done, the issue will be closed.

## Monthly newsletter
At the beginning of every month an issue will be created. It will have
'Newsletter Collection Box' in it's name. Anyone can post links to
blog posts, news articles related to Python on this issue.

All the links will be compiled together and saved as
`community_news.md` in that months directory. It will be presented
during the meetup as well.
