          We are a diverse community of attendees & volunteers ranging
          from people who use Python for their day job to people who
          aren’t from a technical background but use Python to solve
          interesting problems or just have fun using it. We always
          make sure that everyone follows the [code of
          conduct](/code-of-conduct).

          Linkstatus, bot-irc, rsvp-lib and our website are some of
          the [projects](https://github.com/pythonpune/) that our
          volunteers currently maintain. Besides that, we are always
          open to hack on any Free/Libre and Open Source project in
          our monthly meetups. Check out the [developer
          sprints](/tags/devsprint/) which we conducted in past.

          Our meetups are an open platform, we always encourage
          speakers specially the first timers to showcase their work
          or share their knowledge with everyone. All the variety of
          topics which are not just related to Python are
          welcome. Submitting a talk is as easy as filling a [form on
          GitHub](http://cfp.pythonpune.in).
