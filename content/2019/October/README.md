## A Very basic Python Virtual Machine which executes Python byte code
  * **Speaker**: Shinto C V
  * **Description**: Shinto demonstrates his project, which is a toy
    python-virtual-machine. It takes a Python bytecode and executes
    it. He shows how Python bytecode looks like and an intermediate
    assembly like code generated from that bytecode for easy
    understanding.

## Building Serverless Microservices with Zappa
  * **Speaker**: Abdulwahid Barguzar
  * **Description**: In this talk, Abdulwahid gives an overview about
    microservices, ways to deploy them. Then he explains what is
    serverless and how it's beneficial over traditional approach. He
    showcases power of the Zappa tool, which can make it easy to
    deploy microservices written in Python on AWS lambda.

## Removing Named Entities for Legal Querying
  * **Speaker**: Ravina More
  * **Description**: In this talk, Ravina demonstrates the approach
    that she used to remove named entities from a legal query to
    improve the legal extraction. This helps to find a resolved legal
    case that is similar to your case, which is important as well as
    difficult to achieve even when you have sufficient amount of
    historical data.
